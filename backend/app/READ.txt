Welcome to your sandboxed Linux environment!

/app is the main folder containing all tutorials and sample files.
Note: You can only read files here. Writing or modifying anything in /app is not allowed.

/workspace is specially created for you to perform file operations.
You can create, modify, and delete files here safely.
Do NOT try to delete /workspace itself â€” you only have permissions for its contents.

Important Notes:

cd commands may not work as expected, so use ls to explore files.

Because of WORKDIR settings, pwd will always show /app.

This is not a real Linux terminal, so some operations cannot be fully prevented. Type commands carefully by reading the tutorials and sample files first.

If something goes wrong, end the session or exit the website and start again by creating a new session.

The /workspace container is not reset for every session, so you may see files from other learners. Anything harmful or incorrect you find there is your responsibility to delete.

Thank you and happy Linux learning!
