Welcome to the Linux Playground Sandbox!

This project is designed to help first-time Linux users explore basic commands safely.
Each folder represents a stepping stone to learn Linux:
- navigation_101: Basic navigation and file exploration
- file_operation_101: Safe file commands like cp, mv, wc
- fun_and_games_101: ASCII art, terminal games, and fun commands
- system_info_101: Learn about users, processes, and system info
- basic_networking_101: Safe networking commands to explore your system

Use the /execute API endpoint to try commands safely inside this sandbox.
Have fun exploring Linux!
